# mobilenet :: bottleneck_settings


The `bottleneck_settings` in the provided MobileNetV2 module are critical for defining the architecture of the network, particularly the bottleneck layers which are a key component of MobileNetV2. 

### Understanding Bottleneck Settings

In MobileNetV2, a bottleneck layer consists of the following:
1. **Expansion Phase**: The input tensor is expanded to a higher-dimensional space.
2. **Depthwise Convolution**: A depthwise convolution is applied to each channel separately.
3. **Projection Phase**: The tensor is projected back to a lower-dimensional space.
4. **Residual Connection**: A skip connection or shortcut between the input and output of the bottleneck if the input and output dimensions match.

### Format of `bottleneck_settings`
The `bottleneck_settings` is a list of lists, where each inner list specifies the configuration for one bottleneck stage in the format:
```python
[num_repeat, in_channels, out_channels, stride, expansion_factor]
```
- **`num_repeat`**: Number of times the bottleneck block is repeated.
- **`in_channels`**: Number of input channels to the bottleneck block.
- **`out_channels`**: Number of output channels from the bottleneck block.
- **`stride`**: Stride used in the first bottleneck block of the stage.
- **`expansion_factor`**: Factor by which the number of channels is expanded in the expansion phase.

### Example of Bottleneck Settings
Let's examine the provided `bottleneck_settings`:

```python
bottleneck_settings = [
    [1, 32, 16, 1, 1],  # Stage 1
    [2, 16, 24, 2, 6],  # Stage 2
    [3, 24, 32, 2, 6],  # Stage 3
    [4, 32, 64, 2, 6],  # Stage 4
    [3, 64, 96, 1, 6],  # Stage 5
    [3, 96, 160, 2, 6], # Stage 6
    [1, 160, 320, 1, 6] # Stage 7
]
```

### Detailed Breakdown
1. **Stage 1**: 
    - **Configuration**: `[1, 32, 16, 1, 1]`
    - **Description**: 1 bottleneck block with 32 input channels, 16 output channels, stride of 1, and expansion factor of 1.

2. **Stage 2**: 
    - **Configuration**: `[2, 16, 24, 2, 6]`
    - **Description**: 2 bottleneck blocks, first with 16 input channels, 24 output channels, stride of 2, and expansion factor of 6. The second block has the same configuration but stride of 1.

3. **Stage 3**: 
    - **Configuration**: `[3, 24, 32, 2, 6]`
    - **Description**: 3 bottleneck blocks, first with 24 input channels, 32 output channels, stride of 2, and expansion factor of 6. The remaining two blocks have the same configuration but stride of 1.

4. **Stage 4**: 
    - **Configuration**: `[4, 32, 64, 2, 6]`
    - **Description**: 4 bottleneck blocks, first with 32 input channels, 64 output channels, stride of 2, and expansion factor of 6. The remaining three blocks have the same configuration but stride of 1.

5. **Stage 5**: 
    - **Configuration**: `[3, 64, 96, 1, 6]`
    - **Description**: 3 bottleneck blocks, all with 64 input channels, 96 output channels, stride of 1, and expansion factor of 6.

6. **Stage 6**: 
    - **Configuration**: `[3, 96, 160, 2, 6]`
    - **Description**: 3 bottleneck blocks, first with 96 input channels, 160 output channels, stride of 2, and expansion factor of 6. The remaining two blocks have the same configuration but stride of 1.

7. **Stage 7**: 
    - **Configuration**: `[1, 160, 320, 1, 6]`
    - **Description**: 1 bottleneck block with 160 input channels, 320 output channels, stride of 1, and expansion factor of 6.

### Importance of Bottleneck Settings
The bottleneck settings are essential because they:
- **Define the Architecture**: They dictate how many layers, channels, and operations are used at each stage, shaping the overall architecture of MobileNetV2.
- **Control Model Size and Complexity**: The settings allow fine-tuning of the model’s depth and width, affecting both computational cost and accuracy.
- **Enable Flexibility**: By adjusting these settings, you can create variations of MobileNetV2 that can be optimized for different hardware constraints and applications.

### Conclusion
In summary, the `bottleneck_settings` list is crucial for specifying the architecture of the bottleneck layers in MobileNetV2. They control the number of repetitions, input/output channels, stride, and expansion factor for each bottleneck stage, ultimately defining the network’s structure, efficiency, and performance.
